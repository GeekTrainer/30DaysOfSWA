Welcome to the first day of **#30DaysOfSWA** - our new month-long content series where we explore the amazing world of [Azure Static Web Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/overview) (SWA) from core concepts to usage examples, developer tools and best practices. 

## About The Series

[Azure Static Web Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/overview) (SWA) is a service that automatically builds and deploys full-stack web apps to Azure from your code repository. The service [became generally available](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/azure-static-web-apps-is-now-generally-available/) on May 12, 2021. 

We wanted to celebrate it's first anniversary this May with a learning tour of the service features and tooling, and help you bring your app ideas to life! Content is organized into 4 themed weeks based on  [this roadmap](/roadmap) :
 * **Week 1: Core Concepts** - Learn basic terminology, build & deploy an SWA.
 * **Week 2: Usage Examples** - Explore  various app scenarios and frameworks.
 * **Week 3: Developer Tools** - Learn to develop, debug, deploy, and test, your SWA!
 * **Week 4:Best Practices** - Explore service integrations and development tips.

Each article should take less than 5 minutes to read, and end with an activity or tutorial that will help reinforce what you learned. Content is designed to be beginner-friendly though we assume you have some familiarity with web development. Feedback is always welcome - share it on our [Discussion](https://github.com/orgs/staticwebdev/discussions/categories/-30daysofswa) board under `#30DaysOfSWA`.

## Week 1: A Visual Roadmap

Week 1 will focus on core concepts you need to know for Azure Static Web Apps. 
* We'll start by introducing the big picture, building your first SWA and adding a serverless API endpoint. 
* Next, we'll look at configuring application behaviors and build processes - and securing SWA with authentication and authorization support. 
* Finally, we'll talk about deployment - from previewing staged versions of SWA to using custom domains and deploying from other code source platforms.

By the end of the week you should be familiar with SWA terminology and developer workflows - and be ready to explore usage scenarios with various front-end frameworks or static site generators!
