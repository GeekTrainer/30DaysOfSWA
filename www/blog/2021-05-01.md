Welcome to the first day of **#30DaysOfSWA** - our new month-long content series where we explore the amazing world of [Azure Static Web Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/overview) (SWA) from core concepts to usage examples, developer tools and best practices.

## On #30DaysOfSWA?

They say it takes 30 days to make a habit. In general, we've found that doing something consistently for a long period of time helps create focus and builds expertise. And that's also true for learning. So join us for 30 days of fun and functional articles that provide a guided tour of the [Azure Static Web Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/overview) (SWA) service and ecosystem.

_So, why now?_

Azure Static Web Apps [became generally available](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/azure-static-web-apps-is-now-generally-available/) on May 12, 2021 - making May 2022 a milestone month as we celebrate the first [#SWAanniversary](./2021-04-30.md). With a kickoff on May 1, that gives us 30 days till the end of May to celebrate all the things we love about modern web development, Azure Static Web Apps, and learning together. 

## What will we cover?

Take a look at the tentative [Roadmap](./../src/pages/roadmap.md) we've planned for this series. We've organized the journey into four stages, each building on the previous one in a way that mimics the developer experience with any new technology:
 * **Week 1:** We focus on Core Concepts, learning terminology and getting setup.
 * **Week 2:** We explore Usage Examples with different applications and technologies.
 * **Week 3:** We skill up on Developer Tools to help develop, debug, test, and deploy, SWA!
 * **Week 4:** We wrap with Best Practices, exploring service integrations and e2e dev experiences.

Each article should take less than 5 minutes to read, and end with an activity or tutorial that will help reinforce what you learned. Content is designed to be beginner-friendly though we assume you have some familiarity with web development. Feedback is always welcome - share it on our [Discussion](https://github.com/orgs/staticwebdev/discussions/categories/-30daysofswa) board under `#30DaysOfSWA`.
