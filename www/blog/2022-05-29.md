Welcome to `Week 4, Day 7` of **#30DaysOfSWA**!! 

We're at the last post of the series, so let's close the loop to where we started on Day 1. We started by talking about End-to-End Developer Experiences built on Azure Static Web Apps - and continued with a series of posts exploring various Azure service integrations that showcase this vision.

Wouldn't it be great if you could have one end-to-end development example that you could use as a **starter** for your next prototype? Let's end this week with the perfect example. Today we'll look at an end-to-end developer workflow for a full-stack app:
 * Front-end built with React
 * Back-end built with Azure Functions
 * Deployed using Azure Static Web Apps
 * With a MongoDB database 
 * Accessed using Mongoose via CosmosDB API.
 * (Optionally, with Playwright testing)

## What We'll Cover
