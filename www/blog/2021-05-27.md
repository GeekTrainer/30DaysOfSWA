Welcome to `Week 4, Day 5` of **#30DaysOfSWA**!! 

Yesterday we talked about .... Today we'll explore ...

## What We'll Cover
* Use existing API endpoints with Static Web Apps
* Switch from managed functions to “bring your own functions”
* Get the benefit of the rich functionality of Azure Functions in your static web app

A power feature of Azure Static Web Apps is the ability to link an existing Functions app to your static web app.

Using an existing Functions app allows you to avoid restrictions of [managed functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/apis). This means you can:

*   Run functions in [any language](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-custom-handlers)
*   Use [triggers and bindings](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-triggers-bindings?tabs=csharp)
*   Implement [Durable Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-overview?tabs=csharp)
*   Use any other Azure Functions features

Using an existing Functions app in Static Web Apps is easy - all your have to do is link the two apps together. Once you create the link, then a Functions app published under the following URL:

```
https://my-functions-app.azurewebsites.net/api/data
```

...is now also available under the `api` route in your static web app. 

For instance:

```
https://red-sea-123.azurestaticapps.net/api/data
```

## Link an existing Functions app

Linking an existing Functions app is a two step process. First you update the [staticwebapp.config.json](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/configuration) file, and then you link the apps via the Azure portal.

### Update the configuration

Open your site's `staticwebapp.config.json` file in an editor and make the following change:

* Set the `api_location` value to an empty string (`""`)

### Link apps in the Azure portal

Next, navigate to your static web app in the Azure portal and make the following changes:

* Click on **Functions** in the *Settings* menu
* Click **Production** in the *Environment* dropdown
* Click **Link to Function app** next to the *Functions type* dropdown
* Select your subscription from the *Subscription* dropdown
* Select your Functions app name from the *Function App* dropdown
* Click the **Link** button

Now your Functions app is linked to your website and is available under the `api` route!
