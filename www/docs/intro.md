# Get Started With SWA

Azure Static Web Apps comes with a number of development tools and options that align to different developer preferences. In this section we'll use a _vanillaJS_ web app (no front-end framework) to understand the different options available for your build/deploy developer workflow.

## Quickstart Options

Let's start with a basic web app and learn to build and deploy it to Static Web Apps using one of three options, based on your preferred developer experience:
 1. Using an IDE = Visual Studio Code
 2. Using a terminal = Azure CLI
 3. Using a browser = Azure Portal

In each of these cases, we use a _starter project_ that contains the application code, and focus primarily on configuring it for automated build/deploy with SWA. You can follow a similar approach with any other pre-existing app repo (e.g., one of your projects). 
 * If your project uses a front-end framework, [configure the build process](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/front-end-frameworks) to suit the specific application _artifact location_ and _build command_ required.
 * Check back periodically for more quickstart tutorials that focus on specific (popular or niche) front-end frameworks and static site generator options, that illustrate these changes with code.

## Use: Visual Studio Code

Azure Static Web Apps publishes a website by building an app from a code repository. In this quickstart, you deploy an application to Azure Static Web apps using the Visual Studio Code extension.

## Use: Azure CLI

Azure Static Web Apps publishes a website to a production environment by building apps from a GitHub repository. In this quickstart, you deploy a web application to Azure Static Web apps using the Azure CLI.

## Use: Azure Portal

Azure Static Web Apps publishes a website to a production environment by building apps from a GitHub repository. In this quickstart, you deploy a web application to Azure Static Web apps using the Azure portal.
