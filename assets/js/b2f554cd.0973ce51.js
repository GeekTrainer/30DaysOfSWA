The service [became generally available](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/azure-static-web-apps-is-now-generally-available/) on May 12, 2021. \\n\\nWe wanted to celebrate it\'s first anniversary this May with a learning tour of the service features and tooling, and help you bring your app ideas to life! Content is organized into 4 themed weeks based on  [this roadmap](/roadmap) :\\n * **Week 1: Core Concepts** - Learn basic terminology, build & deploy an SWA.\\n * **Week 2: Usage Examples** - Explore  various app scenarios and frameworks.\\n * **Week 3: Developer Tools** - Learn to develop, debug, deploy, and test, your SWA!\\n * **Week 4:Best Practices** - Explore service integrations and development tips.\\n\\nEach article should take less than 5 minutes to read, and end with an activity or tutorial that will help reinforce what you learned. Content is designed to be beginner-friendly though we assume you have some familiarity with web development. Feedback is always welcome - share it on our [Discussion](https://github.com/orgs/staticwebdev/discussions/categories/-30daysofswa) board under `#30DaysOfSWA`.\\n \\n---\\n\\n## About The People\\n\\nThis is a labor of love with contributions from multiple folks across the Microsoft Developer Relations and Static Web Apps product teams. Contributors are listed in alphabetical order (by last name) - check back for updates as the series progresses.\\n\\n * **Nitya Narasimhan**, Senior Cloud Advocate, Microsoft\\n * **Reshmi Sriram**, Static Web Apps PM, Microsoft\\n * \\n * \\n\\n---\\n\\n## Week 1: A Visual Roadmap\\n\\nWeek 1 will focus on core concepts you need to know for Azure Static Web Apps. \\n* We\'ll start by introducing the big picture, building your first SWA and adding a serverless API endpoint. \\n* Next, we\'ll look at configuring application behaviors and build processes - and securing SWA with authentication and authorization support. \\n* Finally, we\'ll talk about deployment - from previewing staged versions of SWA to using custom domains and deploying from other code source platforms. \\n\\n![](../static/img/series/roadmap.png)\\n\\nBy the end of the week you should be familiar with SWA terminology and developer workflows - and be ready to explore usage scenarios with various front-end frameworks or static site generators!\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Ready To Learn? Let\'s Go!\\n\\n![](../static/img/logo.svg)"}]}')}}]);
